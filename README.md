# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
For this analysis, Amazon datasets were used to look at reviews of specific products. In this case, I chose a video games dataset. The reviews were used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in our dataset. 

## Results
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
   * There were 4,291 vine reviews and 1,781,706 non-vine reviews.
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
   * There were 1,607 five star vine reviews and 1,025,317 five star non-vine reviews.
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
   * 37.5% of the vine reviews were five stars compared to 57.9% of non-vine reviews.
   
## Summary 

There does not seem to be bias considering the unapaid reviews have a higher 5 star rating. To expand upon this analysis, we could look at 4 and 5 star reviews to more accurately determine if there is bias.
